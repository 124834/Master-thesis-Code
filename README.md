Attention!!!!

For EXE program, you can find the solution in ExeProgram\Exe Program\bin\ExeSolution. The ExeSolution under the ExeProgram folder was the latest exe solution for user to open conveniently. But if you change any settings in the main code file, the new exe solution will be updated in the file location I talked before

 If you need the latest version of machine learnning model or point wise evaluation or segments wise evaluation, just download "Version 2 code" is enough. Version 1 is the old version, which is useless. We just upload Machine learnning Version 1 as a milestone.
